The main goal of this analysis is to find the driving factors of defaulters for a
consumer finance company.
This will help the company in identifying patterns which indicate if a person is likely
to default or not.
This information may be used for taking actions such as:
1. denying the loan
2. reducing the amount of loan
3. lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate
4. minimizing credit losses
